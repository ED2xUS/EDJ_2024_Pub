  "The primary purpose of Loopalyzer is to visualise how the Loop closed loop system performs. It may work with other setups as well, both closed and open loop, and non loop. However depending on which uploader you use, how frequent it is able to capture your data and upload, and how it is able to backfill missing data some graphs may have gaps or even be completely empty. Always ensure the graphs look reasonable. Best is to view one day at a time and scroll through a number of days first to see.": "",
